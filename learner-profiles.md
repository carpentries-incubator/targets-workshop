---

These are fictional examples of the sort of learner expected to take this workshop.

**Dayja** is a graduate student in evolutionary biology.
She is familiar with R and writes many R scripts to conduct her analyses, but she often finds that it is difficult to remember which scripts to run in what order when she updates her data.

**Jessie** is an undergraduate who is using Quarto to write their graduate thesis.
They want to make sure all the results presented in the thesis come directly from code to avoid any errors and to make it easier for submission to a journal later.

**Vincent** is a post-doc in bioinformatics.
He has to orchestrate large workflows that run the same set of steps over many samples.
He wants to simplify his code to avoid repetition.
