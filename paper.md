# Summary

Reproducibility is critical for sustainable science.
While reproducibility of data analysis can be greatly improved by using code, the results of loosely or poorly organized code may be difficult or impossible to reproduce.
Furthermore, as a project grows in complexity, it becomes difficult to manually track which steps of an analysis need to be re-run due to changes in the code base.
The targets R package automates data analysis workflows in R, thus greatly improving both reproducibility and efficiency, and is rapidly becoming the de-facto workflow manager package in R.
However, targets adopts functions-focused approach that is different from the way most beginners write R code, and little documentation exists to help onboard researchers seeking to use targets.

Here, we present a one-day workshop based on the highly successful Carpentries format to teach targets to beginners.
Although no specialized knowledge of any field is required, the workshop is designed for researchers at the advanced undergraduate level and above, and presumes a basic working knowledge of R.

# Statement of Need

targets is difficult for beginners to learn because it executes R code in an non-interactive session and heavily relies on user-defined functions.
While the documentation provided by the package is extensive, it is not necessarily easy for beginners to access.
This workshop fills the need for targets curriculum focused on researchers with basic R skills but who have never used targets before.
