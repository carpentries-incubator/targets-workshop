## General notes

The examples gradually build up to a [full analysis](https://github.com/joelnitta/penguins-targets) of the [Palmer Penguins dataset](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/). However, there are a few places where completely different code is demonstrated to explain certain concepts. Since a given `targets` project can only have one `_targets.R` file, this means the participants may have to delete their existing `_targets.R` file and write a new one to follow along with the examples. This may cause frustration if they can't keep a record of what they have done so far. One solution would be to save the old `_targets.R` file as `_targets_old.R` or similar, then rename it when it should be run again.
